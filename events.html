                Did the participants use similar courses previously? | Did they like it?
            On 15th of November, students of ADA University: Nurlan Alakbarli, Rufat Miriyev, Lala Aslanova and Nasib Pashayev hosted the “Hour of Code” event with the DP1 (10th Grade) students at Dunya IB School. 
            Before conducting the lesson, we as a team collaborated numerous times to plan the structure of our upcoming event and distribute the roles among the members of the group. Upon our arrival at Dunya IB School, we decided to split the lesson into four parts so that each team-member would receive an equal opportunity to demonstrate their teaching and assisting abilities. 
            Our “Hour of Code” lecture commenced with a small peptalk, alongside with a presentation, about ADA University, covering all the advantageous aspects and opportunities ADA students benefit from, while studying there. Shortly after the introduction part, we proceeded by launching the “Classic Maze puzzle” on Code.Org platform. The puzzle consisted of 20 unique missions, where each member demonstrated 5 levels. 
            We were lucky enough to be assigned with a 10th grade “Computer Science” class; thus, it was relatively easy for us to smoothly teach the students, especially when they were actively participating throughout the 60 minute lecture. Some of the students were already familiar with the Code.Org platform and by engaging in our event, they managed to refresh and further expand their simple algorithmic and programming knowledge. Although the vast majority of them were quite unfamiliar with the website, we managed to flawlessly bring them on track and made sure that no student was left behind by keeping up their progress. By the end of the session, all students successfully completed the course and were granted with a certificate. 
            At the end, we did a quick Q&A to get a small feedback on our performance and as a result each student was very satisfied with the lesson and even their teacher praised us for outstanding work. Overall, Code.Org is a superb platform with fascinating interactive games that significantly boosted the programming abilities of students.
