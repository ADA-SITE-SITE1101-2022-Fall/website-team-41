            <h1>Detailed Report | Hour of Code </h1>

            <p>
                What happened during the Hour of Code? | Did the participants use similar courses previously? | Did they
                like it?
                On 15th of November, students of ADA University: Nurlan Alakbarli, Rufat Miriyev, Lala Aslanova and
                Nasib Pashayev hosted the “Hour of Code” event with the DP1 (10th Grade) students at Dunya IB School.
                Before conducting the lesson, we as a team collaborated numerous times to plan the structure of our
                upcoming event and distribute the roles among the members of the group. Upon our arrival at Dunya IB
                School, we decided to split the lesson into four parts so that each team-member would receive an equal
                opportunity to demonstrate their teaching and assisting abilities.
                Our “Hour of Code” lecture commenced with a small peptalk, alongside with a presentation, about ADA
                University, covering all the advantageous aspects and opportunities ADA students benefit from, while
                studying there. Shortly after the introduction part, we proceeded by launching the “Classic Maze puzzle”
                on Code.Org platform. The puzzle consisted of 20 unique missions, where each member demonstrated 5
                levels.
            </p>
            <p>
                We were lucky enough to be assigned with a 10th grade “Computer Science” class; thus, it was relatively
                easy for us to smoothly teach the students, especially when they were actively participating throughout
                the 60 minute lecture. Some of the students were already familiar with the Code.Org platform and by
                engaging in our event, they managed to refresh and further expand their simple algorithmic and
                programming knowledge. Although the vast majority of them were quite unfamiliar with the website, we
                managed to flawlessly bring them on track and made sure that no student was left behind by keeping up
                their progress. By the end of the session, all students successfully completed the course and were
                granted with a certificate.
                At the end, we did a quick Q&A to get a small feedback on our performance and as a result each student
                was very satisfied with the lesson and even their teacher praised us for outstanding work. Overall,
                Code.Org is a superb platform with fascinating interactive games that significantly boosted the
                programming abilities of students.
            </p>
            <p>
                How well they progressed through the course? | What went well, what did not?
                In the beginning of the session some pupils were struggling to understand the general concept of the
                puzzles, but once they understood the assignment, they started to intensely show interest. The first
                couple of levels were quite easy for them, as they were part of the introduction. With each consecutive
                level, volunteers were invited to the board to solve the problem with the assistance of our team
                members. As students got comfortable with comprehending and solving the tasks, they were becoming more
                enthusiastic and actively participated throughout the course. Each student, who flawlessly completed a
                specific task, was congratulated with a round of applause, which significantly boosted the motivation of
                other students to participate in the activities.
                With every new level, the number of volunteers was slowly rising, which created a joyful atmosphere in
                the classroom. As the difficulty of tasks was increasing, students were experiencing some difficulties
                solving the problems. However, with our assistance they managed to figure out the algorithms and
                finalize the course.
                Rest of the students, who couldn’t participate in the class activity, were actively following the
                progress on the main projector; thus, were granted with a certificate with the completion of the
                “Classic Maze puzzle”.
            </p>
            <p>
                What did you do for preparation?
                We as a team took the preparation process seriously, as it was the main part of the upcoming event.
                Initially we were struggling with finding an appropriate school that met the assignment criterions.
                During the midterm examination week, our schedules were overloaded with exams and lessons; thus, we had
                to delay the preparation process. As soon as we were done with our examinations, we instantly started
                looking for a suitable school. We finally agreed on the school where our team member has graduated from,
                Dunya IB School. Our team-member later got in touch with the school’s administration and within a couple
                of days we managed to secure a time slot that suited us well. The school supplied us with a classroom
                that could hold at least 20 students and had all the necessary teaching tools available to use.
                Subsequently, within two days prior to our “Hour of Code” session, we have collaborated several times,
                both on campus and online, to discuss the process of teaching during the lesson. We mainly discussed the
                three major aspects of the lesson: introduction, roles, and the way of teaching. For the introduction
                part, we decided on demonstrating a short insight about all the opportunities provided by the ADA
                University in the form of a speech and a presentation. Regarding the roles, we decided on providing a
                fair share of responsibilities to each member, so that all of us could conduct the 1/4 of the event and
                receive an equal opportunity to participate in the lesson. Lastly, for hosting the lecture we used the
                “Classic Maze puzzle” on Code.Org platform that was assigned as a part of the teaching resource. In
                total, there were 20 levels of distinct tasks, and we distributed 5 levels for each member of the group.
            </p>
            <p>
                What were the main challenges?
                While hosting the event we have faced some obstacles that were interfering with the quality of the
                lesson. The first challenge that we faced, as soon as we proceeded to conduct the lesson, was the lack
                of noise regulation. It is an obvious and unavoidable situation where students tend to chit-chat and
                create unnecessary amounts of noise during a lesson.
                Additionally, we have noticed that the main source of noise was coming from the students who weren’t
                taking the lesson seriously and were paying little to no attention to the lecture. Especially when the
                lesson is being taught in a classroom with 20 students, such situations are inevitable. Subsequently
                forming our next difficulty with the class regulation.
                When it comes to classrooms with a high number of students, it is burdensome to control the whole class
                and at the same time keep the productivity of the lesson at its finest. Thankfully we have been assigned
                with their teacher as well who helped us to calm down the pupils, despite all these obstacles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whom do you want to thank for support and how did they help your team?
                We would like to thank the school administration for providing us with this opportunity to host our
                “Hour of Code” event, as well as the principal's assistant who helped us to quickly allocate a time slot
                for our lesson. Finally, we want to wholeheartedly thank the Computer Science teacher, who let us
                conduct the lecture during his lesson and helped us to resolve all technical issues.
