        Hello, dear user. Welcome to our website. This website was created by ADA students who are Nurlan Alakbarli, Lala Aslanova, Rufat Miriyev, and Nasib Pashayev. If you want to get a piece of detailed information about creators, click the about us button. We created this website to complete our 3rd homework assignment from the Principles of Information System class. We would like to thank our valuable instructor Araz Muallim, who allows us to gain experience in this field by giving us the website assignment. We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages to set up our website. To properly use these programming languages on our website, each of us  completed the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses at Codecademy. You can see our progress by following the links below.
